STRIPE PAYMENT LINK SETUP (Netlify)
1) Create a Stripe Payment Link (Products > Payment Links) for:
   - Digital products (one-time)
   - Coaching session (one-time)
   - Training deposit or package (one-time)
2) Replace this placeholder URL across the site:
   https://buy.stripe.com/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PAYMENT_LINK
   - Found in products.html and services.html.

CERTIFICATES
- This site is static. To auto-issue certificates you need an automation:
  Option A (simple): Upload your certificate PDF template to /assets and email it manually to purchasers.
  Option B (automated): Use Zapier/Make:
    Trigger: Stripe "payment_link.payment_completed" (or Checkout Session completed)
    Action: Send email (Gmail/SendGrid/Mailgun) with certificate attachment or link
  Option C (LMS): Deliver course and certificates through TalentLMS/Kajabi, and keep this site as marketing + checkout.

Recommended: Start with Stripe + Zapier/Make automation, then upgrade to Netlify Functions if you want personalized certificates.
